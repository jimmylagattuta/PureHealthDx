Testosterone replacement may reduce insulin requirements in insulin-dependent diabetics. Older male patients may be at a slightly increased risk for the development of prostate enlargement when replacing testosterone. The concurrent use of testosterone with corticosteroids may enhance edema (fluid retention) formation.
