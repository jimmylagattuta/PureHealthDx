  <h2>Step 4: HGH Therapy Consent</h2>

  <p><strong>Informed Consent for Human Growth Hormone Replacement</strong></p>
  <p>I, the undersigned, authorize and give my Informed Consent for the administration of human growth hormone replacement therapy offered by ("PRACTICE").</p>

  <p><strong>INDICATION AND EXPECTED BENEFITS OF HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE REPLACEMENT</strong></p>
  <p>I understand that prescription Human Growth Hormone (HGH) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency (AGHD). This condition is determined from medical history, physical findings, and laboratory tests.</p>
  <p>I understand that the laboratory tests to measure IGF-1 or Somatomedin-C might not meet the criteria to establish adult growth hormone deficiency.</p>
  <p>I understand that Human Growth Hormone replacement therapy may result in improvements in my health associated with declining growth hormone levels, which may include one or more of the following: improved muscle mass, strength, exercise capacity, bone density, immune function, skin thickness, wound healing, memory, lung function, and heart function.</p>
  <p>I understand that my healthcare provider cannot guarantee any health benefits or that there will be no harm from the use of Human Growth Hormone.</p>

  <p><strong>RISKS OF HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE REPLACEMENT</strong></p>
  <p>I have been fully informed that this treatment may be viewed as new, controversial, and unnecessary by the FDA. While HGH has been used in adults for over twelve years, long-term effects are undetermined.</p>
  <p>HGH is contraindicated in cases of cancer, diabetic retinopathy, pulmonary fibrosis, or recent angioplasty. Intracranial lesions must be inactive, and anti-tumor therapy complete. HGH should be discontinued if there is tumor growth, and should not be used in critical illness or recent trauma cases. Caution is required for diabetic patients.</p>
  <p>The New England Journal of Medicine concluded there is no evidence HGH therapy increases cancer or cardiovascular disease risks, though HGH may raise concerns due to its anabolic effects.</p>

  <p><strong>SIDE EFFECTS OF HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE REPLACEMENT</strong></p>
  <p>Possible side effects include edema, paresthesias, arthralgias, bruising, glucose intolerance, and with excess doses, headaches, joint pain, carpal tunnel, increased blood pressure, or insulin resistance.</p>

  <p><strong>ALTERNATIVES TO HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE REPLACEMENT</strong></p>
  <p>Alternatives include doing nothing, with risks of symptoms and aging-related disease; or treating symptoms with non-hormonal therapies, also with increased disease risk.</p>

  <p><strong>MY COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS WHILE RECEIVING HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE REPLACEMENT</strong></p>
  <p>I agree to adhere to treatment, including injections, periodic monitoring (labs, physicals), report side effects, follow lifestyle guidance, and disclose all medications and supplements. I understand social substances may affect therapy.</p>
  <p>I affirm I am under care of a physician for all other medical conditions.</p>

  <p><strong>RESEARCH AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS</strong></p>
  <p>I understand the prescribing physician has no unrelated economic interests or research conflicts.</p>

  <p>I certify that I had the opportunity to ask all questions, received all information, and believe I have sufficient understanding to provide informed consent.</p>

  <!-- Step 5 -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 5: Testosterone Therapy Consent</h2>

    <p>I, the undersigned, authorize and give my Informed Consent for the administration of testosterone replacement therapy offered by (‚ÄúPRACTICE‚Äù): Pure Health &amp; Wellness 1130 Coffee Rd, Modesto, CA 95355 (Patient &amp; Practice are referred to individually as ‚ÄúParty‚Äù or collectively as ‚ÄúParties‚Äù)</p>

    <p><strong>EXPECTED BENEFITS of TESTOSTERONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY</strong></p>
    <p>Expected benefits include control of symptoms associated with declining testosterone levels. Possible benefits of this therapy may help prevent, reduce or control physical diseases and dysfunction associated with declining testosterone levels, through hormonal replacement.</p>
    <p>I have been fully informed, and I am satisfied with my understanding, that this treatment may be viewed by the medical community as new, controversial, and unnecessary by the Food and Drug Administration. I understand that my healthcare provider cannot guarantee any health benefits or that there will be no harm from the use of testosterone replacement therapy.</p>

    <p><strong>RISKS and SIDE EFFECTS of TESTOSTERONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY</strong></p>
    <p>Some of the following risks/adverse reactions are derived from the official Food and Drug Administration ‚ÄúFDA‚Äù labeling requirements for testosterone, for therapeutic drug levels in the bloodstream. My healthcare provider may prescribe testosterone at dosages designed to achieve physiologic levels of testosterone in my blood or urine generally associated with those of a 20‚Äì35-year-old person and would be within the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or ‚Äúaverage‚Äù blood concentrations of that age group.</p>
    <p>Risks and Adverse Effects: I understand that the general risks of this proposed therapy may include, but are not limited to, bruising, soreness or pain, and possible infection for testosterone administered by injection or pellet implants.</p>
    <p>Currently there are no testosterone supplement products approved by the FDA for usage by women.</p>
    <p>I understand that there are risks (both known and unknown) to any medical procedure, treatment and therapy, and that it is not possible to guarantee or give assurance of a successful result. I acknowledge and accept these known and unknown general risks.</p>
    <p>A prescription testosterone, administered by injection, pellet implants, transdermal cream or patch.</p>
    <p>Risks of testosterone replacement include but are not limited to: stimulation of benign and malignant prostate tumor. Testosterone replacement is contraindicated in patients with known prostate cancer.</p>
    <p>The FDA requires manufacturers to add a caution to the warning label that testosterone could increase the risk of heart attack and blood clots in veins and could increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; and that the drugs are only approved to treat low testosterone levels caused by injury or disease.</p>
    <p>Side effects of testosterone replacement may include but are not limited to: an abnormal increase in the number of red blood cells, determined by periodic measuring of your blood. While not a common occurrence and generally posing no health risk, it can be corrected by donating blood or with a therapeutic phlebotomy. Male pattern baldness, gynecomastia (breast enlargement), diminished sperm production (infertility) and a reduction in the size of the testicles (testicular atrophy) may develop in men. Testosterone replacement may reduce insulin requirements in insulin-dependent diabetics. Older male patients may be at a slightly increased risk for the development of prostate enlargement when replacing testosterone. The concurrent use of testosterone with corticosteroids may enhance edema (fluid retention) formation. Edema may be a complication with testosterone replacement in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. Sleep apnea may be worsened by testosterone replacement. It has not been established whether testosterone replacement therapy will increase the risk for prostate cancer.</p>
    <p>The most common immediate side effects (occurring in approximately no more than 6% of users) include, but are not limited to: acne, application site reaction (rash, itching, or irritation), headache, hypertension (high blood pressure), abnormal liver function tests, and non-cancerous prostate disorder. Other side effects may include greasy hair and skin, a strong body odor, and aggressiveness.</p>
    <p>Testosterone replacement therapy in females is considered an off-label application by the FDA.</p>
    <p>Relative contraindications of testosterone replacement in pre- and postmenopausal women include androgenic alopecia, acne, hirsutism, hyperlipidemia and liver dysfunction. Absolute contraindications are the presence or increased risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, veno-thrombotic episodes and manifest cardiovascular disease.</p>
    <p>Discontinuation of testosterone replacement therapy may be recommended for a period of 1‚Äì2 weeks postoperatively.</p>
    <p>Transdermal testosterone cream can be transmitted by direct contact. We have advised you of the potential harm of transference to others and how to avoid transference to others.</p>

    <p><strong>ALTERNATIVES to TESTOSTERONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY</strong></p>
    <p>I understand the reasonable alternatives to testosterone replacement therapy, which include: Leaving the testosterone levels as they are and doing nothing. Risks may include but are not limited to: experiencing symptoms of testosterone deficiency, and increased risk for aging-related diseases or dysfunction resulting from declining testosterone levels. This alternative may result in the need to treat diseases or dysfunction associated with declining testosterone levels as they appear clinically; treating the symptoms of declining testosterone levels as they develop with non-hormonal therapies. Risks may include, but are not limited to: increased risk for aging-related diseases resulting from declining testosterone levels.</p>

    <p><strong>MY COMPLIANCE OBLIGATION WHILE RECEIVING TESTOSTERONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY</strong></p>
    <p>I agree to comply with the proposed treatment and therapy as prescribed, including the fact that I may be responsible for injecting, taking by mouth, applying to my skin, or administrating the testosterone(s) that may be prescribed to me, and consent to periodic monitoring, when requested, which may include Laboratory monitoring of blood, saliva or urine chemistries and testosterone levels, Physical examinations, and Regular screening evaluations.</p>
    <p>I agree to notify you regarding all signs or symptoms of possible reactions to my therapy.</p>
    <p>I agree to comply with all other healthy lifestyle activities that have been individually recommended for me. I have completely disclosed my medical history, including prescription and non-prescription medications that I am currently taking or plan to take during my treatment, as well as any other over-the-counter medications, recreational drugs or social substances, herbs, extracts, and other dietary supplements to you. I agree to comply with the recommendations regarding the continuation or discontinuation of these preparations.</p>
    <p>In the future, I will receive recommendations in advance from you before stopping any prescribed therapeutic regimens or taking additional preparations that are not recommended by you.</p>
    <p>I certify that I am under the care of a physician(s) for any and all other medical conditions.</p>

    <p><strong>RESEARCH and ECONOMIC INTERESTS</strong></p>
    <p>I understand that the prescribing practitioner is not engaged in any personal research and has no economic interests unrelated to my immediate care or treatment that may affect the physician‚Äôs choice of treatment or medical judgment.</p>

    <p><strong>ATTESTATION &amp; CONSENT</strong> I certify that I have been given the opportunity to ask any and all questions I have concerning the proposed treatment, and I received all requested information, and all questions were answered. I fully understand that I have the right to not consent to testosterone replacement therapy. I believe I have adequate knowledge upon which to base an informed consent. I do now attest to reading and fully understanding this form and the contents and clinical meanings of such and discussing these procedures with my healthcare provider and consent to this treatment, and hereby affix my signature to this authorization for this proposed long-term treatment. I have been given a copy of this consent form, and I understand fully any and all the possibly represented implications and meanings of its writing and expectations.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Controlled Substance Refill Consent</h2>

    
    <p>I understand that Pure Health &amp; Wellness has enrolled my controlled substance medication in Tailor Made Compounding‚Äôs auto-refill program.</p>

    <p><strong>Liability and Responsibility:</strong></p>
    <p>I understand that TMC will not call and/or email to notify me or Pure Health &amp; Wellness that my medication is being refilled.</p>
    <p>I understand that this form is a legal replacement in regards to receiving a call to notify me that my prescription is due to be filled and will be shipped to me without confirmation.</p>
    <p>I understand that it is my responsibility to immediately report any change in regards to my shipping address.</p>
    <p>I understand that I will be held responsible for notifying Tailor Made Compounding in the event my controlled substance package(s) are lost/stolen. I will inquire about the next steps for contacting UPS and filing a police report, and I fully understand if I do not take these next steps that I may not be eligible for any medication replacements.</p>
    <p>I understand that I will be held responsible for any added expenses of lost or stolen packages.</p>
    <p>I understand that I will be responsible for notifying TMC if I have a pause and/or discontinuation of medication.</p>
