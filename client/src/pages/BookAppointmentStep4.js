                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I understand that prescription Human Growth Hormone (HGH) has
                been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
                treatment of Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency (AGHD). This
                condition is determined from medical history, physical findings,
                and laboratory tests.
              </p>
              <p>
                I understand that the laboratory tests to measure IGF-1 or
                Somatomedin-C might not meet the criteria to establish adult
                growth hormone deficiency.
              </p>
              <p>
                I understand that Human Growth Hormone replacement therapy may
                result in improvements in my health associated with declining
                growth hormone levels, which may include one or more of the
                following: improved muscle mass, strength, exercise capacity,
                bone density, immune function, skin thickness, wound healing,
                memory, lung function, and heart function.
              </p>
              <p>
                I understand that my healthcare provider cannot guarantee any
                health benefits or that there will be no harm from the use of
                Human Growth Hormone.

              <p>
                <strong>RISKS OF HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE REPLACEMENT</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I have been fully informed, and I am satisfied with my
                understanding, that this treatment may be viewed by the medical
                community as new, controversial, and unnecessary by the Food
                and Drug Administration.
              </p>
              <p>
                I understand that while the application of Human Growth Hormone
                has been utilized in adults for more than twelve years its
                long-term effects are undetermined.
              </p>
              <p>
                I understand that HGH is contraindicated when there is any
                evidence of neoplastic (cancer) activity, proliferative diabetic
                retinopathy, pulmonary fibrosis, or recent coronary angioplasty.
                Intracranial lesions must be inactive and anti-tumor therapy
                complete prior to institution of therapy. HGH should be
                discontinued if there is evidence of tumor growth. It should not
                be initiated to treat patients with acute critical illness due
                to complications following open heart or abdominal surgery,
                multiple accidental traumas, or to patients having acute
                respiratory failure. Caution is required when HGH is
                administered to patients with diabetes mellitus, as insulin
                dosage may need to be adjusted.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the New England Journal of Medicine, October 1999,
                concluded, ‚ÄúThere is no evidence that HGH replacement therapy
                affects the risk of cancer or cardiovascular disease,‚Äù I
                understand that questions have been raised about HGH as a cause
                of cancer, since it is an anabolic hormone and makes things
                grow.

                  SIDE EFFECTS OF HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE REPLACEMENT
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>I understand that side effects may occur with the use of HGH.</p>
              <p>
                Possible side effects include but are not limited to: edema
                (swelling) of the hands and ankles, paresthesias (numbness and
                tingling in the hands), arthralgias (joint aching), slight
                bruising at the injection site, and glucose intolerance, at
                least initially, where blood sugar is higher for a given amount
                of sugar or equivalent consumed. Excess doses may result in
                fluid retention in the hands and feet. Continued fluid retention
                could lead to headaches and/or joint pain, and possibly carpal
                tunnel syndrome, increased blood pressure or insulin resistance.

              </p>
              <p>
                I am totally and completely satisfied with my understanding of
                the reasonable alternatives to human growth hormone replacement,
                which include:
              </p>
              <p>
                Leaving the hormone levels as they are and doing nothing. Risks
                may include but are not limited to: experiencing symptoms of
                growth hormone deficiency and an increased risk for
                aging-related diseases or dysfunction resulting from declining
                growth hormone levels. This alternative may result in the need
                to treat diseases or dysfunction associated with declining
                growth hormone levels as they appear clinically.
              </p>
              <p>
                Treating the symptoms of declining growth hormone levels as they
                develop with non-hormonal therapies. Risks may include, but are
                not limited to: increased risk for aging-related diseases
                resulting from declining hormone levels.
